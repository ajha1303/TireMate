TireMate
TireMate is an Arduino based tire monitoring system that measures tire pressure and temperature and displays the live data on a website. This project uses a direct TPMS system to monitor tire pressure and a temperature sensor to monitor tire temperature.

Components Used
NodeMCU
Pressure sensor
Temperature sensor
Jumper wires
Software Used
Arduino IDE
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the website
Features
Measures tire pressure and temperature in real-time
Displays live data on a website
Allows you to monitor tire pressure and temperature remotely
Alerts you if tire pressure or temperature goes outside the desired range
Installation
Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
Connect the NodeMCU to your computer using a USB cable.
Install the necessary libraries for the NodeMCU and pressure and temperature sensors.
Upload the code to the NodeMCU using the Arduino IDE.
Set up the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Host the website on a server.
Usage
Connect the pressure and temperature sensors to the NodeMCU using jumper wires.
Turn on the NodeMCU.
Open the website in a web browser.
Monitor the tire pressure and temperature in real-time.
